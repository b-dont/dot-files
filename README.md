# My dot files

These are my dot files and configs. I manage these files using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). 

If you'd like to install any of these files, install GNU Stow and run `stow <package>` from the root directory. Replace `<package>` with the application name you'd like to install the config files for.

```bash
# For Example, if you'd like to install the zsh configs, make sure the files do not already exists in your home directory,
# I would recommend backing up your previous files first, then run the following:

stow zsh
```
