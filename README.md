# My dot files

These are my dot files and configs. I manage these files using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). 

If you'd like to install any of these files, install GNU Stow and run the `install.sh` script from the `dots` directory, or manually run the `stow` commands like so:

```bash
# Replace <package> with the package name you'd like to install.

stow -t $HOME -S <package>
```
